Child Mind Institute Research
VISION STATEMENT
A world where every child has access to mental health care that is efficient, effective, and personalized. 

MISSION STATEMENT
Timely, accurate diagnoses, and efficient interventions are central to our vision. As such, our mission is to accelerate the pace of scientific innovation and discovery in child mental health and learning. We are committed to democratizing inquiry by making tools and data freely available to the global scientific community. This helps to foster collaborations that can test, improve upon, and adopt innovative open solutions for the benefit of every child.


GUIDING SCIENTIFIC PRINCIPLES
Integrative Multidisciplinary Research. Neuropsychiatry remains a pioneering frontier in modern medicine. In part, this is due to the realities that the brain is the most complex organ in the human body and no single measure or method can capture the complexities of its development and maturation - let alone the impact of mental health and learning disorders. As such, our scientific team draws upon a range of disciplines, models, and methods in its efforts to chart brain development and identify clinically useful markers of behavior and brain function that are objective, reproducible, and widely accessible. To maximize our opportunities for collaboration and the exchange of ideas, we house our laboratories, scientists, and clinicians in a shared setting.

New Technologies. Standard methods for assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of mental health disorders are antiquated, lack quantitative rigor and reproducibility, and are administered within an unnatural clinical setting, all of which can result in an inaccurate view of a child’s condition. Therefore, a core component of our mission is to build, test, and deploy new technologies (such as sensors, wearable devices, mobile apps, and analytical tools) that can acquire objective, quantitative measures related to mental health in any setting, anywhere in the world.

Scalable Solutions. Recent decades have witnessed the development of myriad potentially viable solutions for diagnosing, monitoring and treating mental health and learning disorders. Unfortunately, even the most promising among them face practical and logistical challenges that will limit their accessibility and scalability if not addressed. Our team is dedicated to the pursuit of scalable solutions that leverage innovative models, methods and technologies to maximize their utility for a global audience so that no child is left behind, regardless of who or where they are. 

Open Science. Research silo cultures stand in the way of scientific progress in the diagnosis and treatment of mental health and learning disorders. As a recognized leader in open science, the Child Mind Institute is committed to democratizing inquiry by making analysis tools and scientific data freely available to the global scientific community. This ensures that collaboration is widespread, producing innovative solutions that can be tested, improved, and adopted widely for the acceleration of scientific progress.

The Tingle Wearable (Gesture Recognition Device)
Status and PatentWe have created a prototype for a wrist-worn device called the “Tingle” that can monitor and record gestures and motions such as body-focused repetitive behaviors (BFRBs) while also providing real-time (haptic) feedback (on the wrist) to the individual. The Tingle is the subject of U.S. Patent Number 10,119,807 and 10,520,297 [Will link to patents]
Description and Usage
This device can monitor BFRBs including hitting oneself, biting, pulling out hair, skin picking and cutting, as well less severe but damaging behaviors such as nail biting, thumb sucking, and nose picking. While often impairing, these symptoms are frequently reported but often not observed in clinical settings. This makes diagnosis, as well as treatment planning and monitoring, exceedingly difficult. Clinicians need data on BFRB frequency and timing for the purposes of diagnosis, treatment planning and monitoring, while patients need immediate, real-time feedback to make behavioral therapies more effective. Not only can this device be helpful for monitoring BFRBs, it can also monitor more generalizable behaviors like face touching, especially relevant now during the COVID-19 outbreak. Results and FutureThe Tingle's performance characteristics in healthy volunteers were studied and published (Son JJ et al., "Thermal Sensors Improve Wrist-Worn Position Tracking," npj Digital Medicine (2019) 2:15). The Tingle is currently a prototype. We are currently seeking opportunities to commercialize (manufacture and distribute) the Tingle for widespread use.


The Thermo Wearable
Status and PatentThe Thermo Wearable is the subject of U.S. Patent No. 10,119,807 and 10,520,297 [Will link to patents]. The Thermo is currently a prototype. Description and UsageThe Thermo wearable uses thermal sensors to track its position relative to the body. This innovative standalone approach to position tracking without cameras has the potential to increase the accuracy of measuring movement in real time. The device is also lightweight, non-intrusive and self-contained, making it ideal for integrating into augmented or virtual reality systems. See the description of the Tingle device, which also serves to track position of the hand with respect to the head and torso, but for a more narrow application (monitoring of body-focused repetitive behaviors). Results and FutureThe Thermo is currently a prototype. We are currently seeking opportunities to commercialize the Thermo for widespread use in position tracking for console game playing, VR, AR, etc.


ODAlert Drug Overdose Detector
Status and PatentThe ODalert device is a prototype. Patent Pending.
Description and UsageThis device is the first in a series of projects exploring wearable device solutions to drug overdose and drug addiction.The primary motivation for building this prototype was to start a discussion with the National Institute on Drug Abuse on potential opportunities to detect opiate overdose with inexpensive devices built from off-the-shelf components. Depressed respiration is the best way to detect opiate overdose and the only approved indicator for the administration of Narcan (Naloxone).Results and FutureThe device contains an accelerometer, a PPG optical heart rate sensor and a thermopile contactless thermometer to detect skin temperature. The device also contains an extremely loud buzzer and is connected to a smartphone app which is capable of alerting an emergency response team. The emergency response feature is currently a mockup and does not function. The general idea is that the device uses sensor data to detect a possible drug overdose event. The device then activates its buzzer. If the user does not deactivate the buzzer after an allotted period of time it is assumed that an overdose is taking place and the device alerts emergency responders through the connected phone app. We are working on similar, more practical devices and welcome opportunity for collaboration on this project. 


MindLogger
Status and PatentMindLogger is currently being used to gather survey data as part of the 10,000-person Healthy Brain Network research study. After this initial test, MindLogger will be used in research studies by our collaborators at the National Institute of Mental Health, MIT, UT Austin, the CRI in Paris, and elsewhere.
Description and UsageThe MATTER Lab is developing MindLogger to make it easy for anyone to collect, analyze, and visualize data using mobile devices. We are interested in mental health, so we are building a public library of assessments and interventions. Next on our roadmap is to build an editor panel for users to be able to easily build their own activities, such as surveys, quizzes, digital diaries, or cognitive tasks. This tool is more relevant than ever as healthcare evolves to incorporate more telehealth and remote options. 
Each screen in a MindLogger activity can include: Informational text, picture, or audio, Question followed by image or text response options, Slider bar, Text entry, Table entry (text or numbers), Audio record, Photo/video capture, Draw/tap, GPS button, Simple cognitive task. Each screen can include a delay, a timer, as well as conditional logic to determine where to go next.
Results and Future
MindLogger is currently being used to gather survey data as part of the 10,000-person Healthy Brain Network research study. After this initial test, MindLogger will be used in research studies by our collaborators at the National Institute of Mental Health, MIT, UT Austin, the CRI in Paris, and elsewhere.

CrisisLogger
Status and PatentPatent Pending
Description and Usage
Developed in partnership with researchers at the National Institute of Mental Health, CRI Université de Paris, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and OpenHumans.org, CrisisLogger wants to hear about the emotions that people are experiencing during the COVID-19 Crisis. Through this online platform, users can identify as being from one of several categories, including teachers, parents, and health care workers, and share their struggles, fears, frustrations, hopes, and more—publicly or privately—through audio, video, or text messages. These messages are then all converted into word clouds to capture the theme. Participants can decide whether or not they want to contribute their submissions for scientific research or keep them private. CrisisLogger also allows users to view the public submissions of others, which could help to offer support through shared experiences. 
Results and Future
CrisisLogger is currently collecting data. 


Face Guardian
Status and PatentFace Guardian is entirely open source. Development is ongoing and contributions are welcome.Description and UsageUse a phone's compass and a magnet on your wrist to detect face touching, including audio and vibration alerts. Face touching is one of the primary ways people contract SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus responsible for COVID-19. People on average touch their faces 23 times an hour. Obviously we should stop touching our faces. Thing is, we can’t. Face touching is a deeply ingrained unconscious behavior. Face Guardian is an attempt to solve this problem in a highly scalable fashion. All it requires is a smartphone and a magnet. Face Guardian’s target demographic is parents and children stuck at home during the coronavirus pandemic. Although this is meant to be a fun educational activity for parents and children, anyone can benefit from it. Setup Face Guardian before you read a news article, write some code or procrastinate on the internet. Even with the possibly obtrusive experience of wearing your phone around your neck, you might be surprised at how quickly you inadvertently touch your face.

Intraoral Respiration Monitor 
Status and PatentThe intraoral respirometer is a prototype and we are seeking patent protection. We are working on similar, more practical devices. Patent accepted, pending issue. [Link to Patent]
Description and UsageThis device measures the air pressure, humidity and skin temperature inside the user’s airway. In short, BME280 air pressure sensor + MLX90615 thermopile thermometer + hacked miniature nRF51822-based activity tracker mounted on an ultra-thin custom dental retainer.
The primary motivation for building this prototype was to start a discussion with the National Institute on Drug Abuse on potential opportunities to detect opiate overdose with a future, miniaturized version of such a device, or other form factor and placement. Depressed respiration is the best way to detect opiate overdose and the only approved indicator for the administration of Narcan (Naloxone). Full waveform respiration data is surprisingly difficult to obtain. Spirometers, chest-straps and pulse oximetry (including photoplethysmogram) are relatively inaccurate - particularly when respiration becomes depressed.Results and FutureThe device contains a 16Mhz ARM Cortex M0 microprocessor combined with a Bluetooth radio for wireless communication (Nordic nRF51822). We stream data to a Web Bluetooth enabled web application. The streamed data is displayed graphically but can also be used to train and then apply data to a LSTM MLP neural network for the purpose of tracking respiration. The BME280 air pressure sensor is extremely sensitive and can acquire the respiration waveform regardless of whether users breath through nose or mouth. 


Respirometer
Status and PatentUS Patent Application No. 16/816220 Filed 3/11/2020 [Link to Patent]Description and UsageThe device's primary intended use is respiratory rate (RR) vital sign monitoring, although many other uses are possible. The device functions by gathering and analyzing time series data from a number of sensors, namely surface temperature (thermopile), air temperature, air pressure and air water content (humidity). The efficacy of the device is dependent on the presence of an exhalation vent in an oxygen mask, something that is universal to oxygen masks. The device sensors are placed directly over the vent, in a fashion that very clearly does not risk blocking the vent. Results and FutureThe device is capable of independently computing respiration rate from time series sensor data. Currently, this is accomplished with peak detection and relatively simple filtering, but this sort of data processing can be done many different ways. The device contains a Bluetooth radio, and can transmit raw sensor data to a computer or mobile device. Raw sensor data from the device could be incorporated into computer software to provide a great deal more information than simple respiration rate. Respiration strength, volume, acceleration and any abnormalities thereof can be computed. 
The device is attached to the oxygen mask with an adhesive -backed reclosable fastener (like velcro). In order to accommodate a variety of oxygen mask shapes, the sensors themselves are placed in an adjustable hinged arm attached to the main device body. Design of the device for placement inside the mask is possible but poses an obvious choking hazard. It would, however, be straightforward to integrate the device into the oxygen mask itself.
